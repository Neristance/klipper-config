# Klipper Configurations running on my 3D Printers

This repository is meant to share some example configurations and store them for myself. However, if anyone is interested in using them
go ahead! 

Happy Printing folks!

## Voron 2.4

Check out branch [Voron2](https://github.com/Neristance/klipper-config/tree/voron2)

My Voron 2.4 is a 350mm build using the Stealthburner Beta toolhead running on a BTT Octopus
It also has some extra LED lights in the case besides the Stealthbuner LEDs.

While using this config make sure you are adapting the relevant settings:

* Max Dimensions
* Z Offset/Endstop Offsets
* Stepper Driver configurations
* Accelaration and speed limits
* etc.

If you blindly use this it may harm your printer.

All Configurations are based on the once provided by the Voron Design team
